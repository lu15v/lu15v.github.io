        I'm a software developer with 2+ years of experience, I have worked for international consultancy companies and also international clients. 
        I love to: contribute, learn, teach and in general be very engaged in every project I'm in. 
        In my free time, I enjoy learning topics related to web development, playing the ukelele, and developing projects as a freelance and reading some sci-fi books. I want to be part of a team where I can provide my knowledge in projects with high relevance and impact.
